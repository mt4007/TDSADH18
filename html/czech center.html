      <br> When proud immigrants built the 
      <br>Bohemian National Hall in 1896,no                      
     <br>one foresaw the tumultuous century 
      <br>that would follow in their homeland 
      <br>overseas, and in the hall's internal 
      <br>affairs. The building became a mag-
      <br>net for Czech nationalists from Bo-                        <img src="../images/image.png" style="height:900px; width:400px;" alt="Czech Center">
      <br>hemia, a medieval kingdom that fell 
      <br>under Hapsburg rule. In the after-
      <br>math of World War I,the Czechs won 
      <br>independence, but Nazi Germany 
      <br>dismembered Czechoslovakia, which 
      <br>later fell to the Communists. Democracy 
      <br>was restored in 1989, and in 1992, the 
     <br>nation splitinto the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
      <br>The hall, at 321 E. 73d Street, outlasted all 
      <br>that -- surviving, barely, its own misfortunes, 
      <br> feuds and scandals, "We almost lost it," said 
      <br>Jan Hird Pokorny, the president of the Bohemian
      <br>Benevolent and Literary Association, which owns the hall.
      <br> Now the landmarked five-floor facade is being restored. 
      <br>Supporters have raised $99,000 of the $5 million needed 
      <br>to renovate the interior,including a 100-foot-long, 
      <br>two-story ballroom. They envision an ethnic 
      <br>restaurant, social and cultural events, 
      <br>a display on the great Czech composer Antonin Dvorak 
      <br>(who performed to raise money for the original hall) and businesses.

      <br>"In the 80's things looked pretty bleak," said Peter Kutil, a 
      <br>co-chairman of the fund-raising effort. "The underlying 
       <br> problem was the center was for a community that was no longer there. 
      <br>We're trying very hard to bring back not only the building but activity 
      <br>in the Czechoslovak-American community, tied in overseas."Thousands of 
      <br>Czechs migrated to the Lower East Side in the late 1800's,then moved to work 
       <br>in Yorkville's cigar factories. Their hall, expanded by an annex and an adjoining 
       <br>movie theater,drew sports, educational, cultural and social groups. But then the 
       <br>Czechs dispersed, to Astoria and the suburbs. 
      <br>Ethnic ties weakened with assimilation and conflicting views of later immigrants.

      <p>
      <br>The hall spiraled into decline.  In the 1980's, its movie theater was sold and demolished. 
      <br>Some association leaders tried to sell the main hall, but others protested, prompting years  
      <br>of litigation. "That's all in the past," said Mr. Pokorny. Though the association has fallen 
      <br>to 15 member groups from 95, he says it has a new spirit of unity and optimism.There are still 
      <br>critics. John Krondl, the publisher of Czechoslovak News, said it was "unforgivable" that the 
      <br>association took a year and a half to prepare its first fund-raising letter, mailed a few days ago.
      <br>Mr. Kutil said it needed the time to perfect its appeal.
